# Data-Analyst-Metrics
A repository containing my work involving Python, Excel, and Power BI

Description:

In this project I had to create a tool to retrieve data from a website, and print it out into an organized excel file. I walk through most of the project with comments in the file that explain each step. Finally exported the data into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard to present findings to any executives to find trends with the job market in regards of analysis positions.

Can increase the sample size and use other IT keywords to create better results in the future.

Once data was printed to Excel, it had to be cleaned, split, and reorganized for the next phase of the project.
